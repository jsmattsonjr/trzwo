Chrome extension: Zwift ZWO Download for TrainerRoad

A useful tool for cycling and triathlon enthusiasts who train with
both TrainerRoad and Zwift. With a single click on the ‘ZWO’ button on
any TrainerRoad workout page, your workout is converted to a ZWO file,
ready to be used in Zwift. Once you move the downloaded file to your
Zwift directory, it seamlessly integrates into your ‘Custom Workouts’
list for your next session.

The tool converts steady-state intervals, ramps, and
over-unders. There are options available to tweak the workout intervals
for more Zwift XP.

Here’s how easy it is:

1. Install this extension.
2. Visit your chosen workout on TrainerRoad.
3. Use the ‘ZWO’ button to convert and download the workout.
4. Place the file in your Zwift ‘Workouts’ folder, under your Zwift ID directory.

User-configurable options (available from the extension's 'Details' page or by right-clicking the extension's icon in the toolbar, if you have it pinned):
1. Ramp to Steady-State Conversion:
    - None: Leave the ramps as found in the TrainerRoad workout.
    - Internal: Leave only warmup/cooldown ramps (if any).
    - All: Convert all ramps to steady-state intervals.
2. Steady-State to Over-Under Conversion:
   - Strict: Each power target must match exactly when recognizing over-unders.
   - Loose: Some minor variation in power targets is allowed.
   - None: Leave the individual steady-state intervals alone.

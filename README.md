Chrome extension: Zwift ZWO Download for TrainerRoad

For cyclists with subscriptions to both TrainerRoad and Zwift, this
extension will automatically add a 'ZWO' button to TrainerRoad workout
web pages. Click the button to download a TrainerRoad workout in .zwo
format. Move the file from your Downloads folder to your Documents ->
Zwift -> Workouts -> <Numeric Zwift Id> folder before starting Zwift,
and it will appear under "Custom Workouts."

For more information on importing custom workouts into Zwift, see
